This is the code to generate a NextJS React App using WordPress JSON API

## What does this do?
I have been working on creating a complete web CMS archetecture using the greatest technologies on the web today. This will spin up a new NextJS React App complete with tooling for VSCode. It will then create a Wordpress CMS instance to manage products, images, blogs and all other CMS related data.

The WordPress installation uses WooCommerce under the hood to manage products. The NextJS App uses the WP-JSON API to get the data it needs to display on the frontend.

## This is working and needs more ðŸ’“

If you would like to use this to boostrap your architecture you might need my help as the documentation is still lacking. I'm working on ironing out the user experience for the developers, and will have documenation very soon.

If you need a helping hand, please [schedual some time on my calendly.](https://calendly.com/roe_the_dev/code-review)

This code is open source so if you can make it better, please open a PR!

## Wordpress Notes
When useing with wordpress make sure to do the following:
* Enable woocomerce legacy rest api

* If running in a docker container - setup the url to be http://host.docker.internal:port
